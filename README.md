# Text to Voice Converter

This project is a simple Text to Voice Converter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter text into a textarea, select a voice from a dropdown menu, and listen to the text being spoken aloud.

## Features
- Voice Selection: Users can choose different voices based on their preferences (e.g., male, female, or accent variations).
- Text-to-Speech Conversion: Converts the text entered into the textarea to speech using the browser's Web Speech API.
- Responsive UI: The design is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Dependencies
- The project uses the browser's native Web Speech API for text-to-speech conversion. It works on most modern browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Safari.

## Browser Compatibility
- This project relies on the `speechSynthesis` and `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` API, which is supported in most modern browsers but may not work in all versions of Firefox and Internet Explorer. For best results, use Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
